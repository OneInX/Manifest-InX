# Manifest-InX — Contributing

At this time, Manifest-InX does not accept external contributions.

The project is intentionally maintained with a narrow surface area to preserve determinism, reproducibility, and auditability as an enterprise-grade core engine.

If this changes in the future, contribution guidelines will be published here.
