# MicroInX Templates v0.3 — Frozen Pack Source

**T01** — You defer by widening input until signal collapses. Narrow input doesn’t prevent single-channel collapse.
**T02** — You degrade reference by letting definition expand without constraint. A frozen frame doesn’t stop scope creep.
**T03** — You gate action behind unreachable precision. A minimum gate still blocks action.
**T04** — You commit before constraints stabilize. Fast commitment doesn’t prevent rework.
**T05** — You substitute meta-analysis for bounded definition. A tight frame forces signal to resolve.
**T06** — You treat preference as evidence; signal becomes self-confirming. Without counter-signal, drift persists.
**T07** — You create a new axis when the current one binds. Adding dimensions doesn’t increase truth.
**T08** — You hold incompatible premises in the same frame. The frame fractures under contradiction load.
**T09** — You delay by shifting the task boundary. A fixed boundary exposes avoidance.
**T10** — You diverge interpretations under one label. Coherence degrades when one label carries multiple interpretations.
**T11** — You repeat analysis cycles to avoid committing to a bounded definition. The loop persists because reference never becomes final.
**T12** — You gate entry above the minimum; recurrence persists. An entry gate above minimum sustains recurrence.
**T13** — You prioritize parallel output; constraints diverge. Without one rule, divergence is guaranteed.
**T14** — You hold scope open and the primary node degrades; action defers. A hard boundary doesn’t release action.
**T15** — You prioritize output without a lock window; rework is the default. Without a lock window and rate limit, rework persists.
